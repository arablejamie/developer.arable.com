# Contributing Guide

Documentation pages are written in Markdown. Change requests can be made thru GitHub pull requests.

## How to write in Markdown
You can write Markdown in an [online Markdown editor]('https://stackedit.io/') then copy paste to submit.

* [General markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)
