# Introduction

With the Arable REST API, it is a possibility to build applications that allow you or your users to plan, understand, and analyze environmental factors for their needs.

REST APIs provide access to "resources" (data entities) via paths. To use a REST API, your application will make an HTTP request and parse the response. The Jira REST API uses JSON as its communication format, and the standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. 

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed [here](https://api-user.arable.cloud/api/v2/). 
All data is sent and received as JSON.
