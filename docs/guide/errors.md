# Errors

Below are the types of errors that the API has standardized.

### 400: Bad Request
Usually indicates a client error, e.g., not specifying the arguments correctly, or malformed URL.

### 401: Unauthorized
This error indicates that the request was not applied because it was lacking authentication credentials, e.g., missing or incorrect user name and/or password, or missing bearer token. 

### 403: Forbidden
This client error indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it due to reasons such as: user is inactive or user has not signed the current EULA.

### 404: Not Found
This error indicates that the server could not find the requested resource, e.g., device not found, location not found.

### 415: Unsupported Media Type
For POST, PUT, and DELETE requests with a non-empty request body, the `Content-Type` header is required and should be `application/json`. If the header is missing or does not specify a JSON content type, the request will be rejected with an HTTP status code of 415.
